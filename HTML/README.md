Learning Web Design Chapter 4: Creating a Simple Page 
- You can skip the "Launch a Text Editor" section, because we've already learned how to create files in VS Code.
- Keep in mind that the goal of this chapter is not to teach you the `<h1>` or `<img>` elements. These are just useful examples to explain the basics of HTML documents, elements, and attributes. Focus on the "big picture", not the specifics.
- Don't worry too much about Step 5 (CSS). We won't be talking about CSS for awhile, so just use this section to see what CSS looks like.


## Text

**Readings**  
Learning Web Design Chapter 5: Marking up Text
- Don't worry too much about the "More Content Elements" section. These elements are used much less often.
- Don't worry too much about the "Organizing Page Content" section. These elements can often confuse people, and they're completely optional.
- For the "Inline Element Roundup" section, don't worry about learning all of these elements. The important thing is to be aware of what kind of things are available.
- The "Improving Accessibility with Aria" section is important, but don't worry about learning it for now.
