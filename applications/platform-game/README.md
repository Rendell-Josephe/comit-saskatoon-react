# Platform Game

## Description

A 2D Platform Game game that is based on Dark Blue (http://www.lessmilk.com/games/10) by Thomas Palef.

## Requirements

1. The dark box represents the player, whose task is to collect the yellow boxes (coins) while avoiding the red stuff (lava).
2. A level is completed when all coins have been collected.
3. The player can walk around with the left and right arrow keys and can jump with the up arrow. Jumping is a specialty of this game character. It can reach several times its own height and can change direction in midair.
4. The game consists of a static background, laid out like a grid, with the moving elements overlaid on that background. Each field on the grid is either empty, solid, or lava.
5. The moving elements are the player, coins, and certain pieces of lava. The positions of these elements are not constrained to the gridâ€”their coordinates may be fractional, allowing smooth motion.
